      <h1>Q : What is JavaScript ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
        JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
      </p>
      <h1>Q : Where JavaScript script place ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: JavaScript script can place in body or in head , but its best place
        is bottom of body . Placing script in body element it improve the
        display speed . because script interpretation slow down the display.
      </p>
      <h1>Q :What is JavaScript Statements ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: A Computer Programer is list of instruction to be executed by
        Computer. In programming language these instruction called Statements.
      </p>
      <h1>Q :What is JavaScript Programer ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: A JavaScript Programer is s list of Statements. In HTML, JavaScript
        programs are executed by the web browser.
      </p>
      <h1>Q :What is JavaScript Code ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called
        JavaScript code.
      </p>
      <h1>Q :What is concatenation ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: when one value in number and second value is sting than + operator
        concat both values. let x = 5+"10" x=510.If you put a number in quotes,
        the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
      </p>
      <h1>Q :What is Data type ? primitive and non primitive data type</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: <b>Data Type :</b> Data type determine the type of value that can
        be stored in variable. <b>Primitive Data Type </b>: Primitive data type
        are the immutable which means their value cannot be changed or modified
        once there are created. And Holding only one value.(Number ,
        String,null,boolean,) <b>Primitive Data Type </b>: Non Data type can
        hold multiple values or methods. They are th mutable their value can
        change. (Object,Arrays,function,date)
      </p>
      <h1>Q : What is JavaScript Function ? and Type of function .</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: JavaScript Function is a block of code . that can be executed when
        "called" for. For Example : A function is called when a event is occur
        like click on a button .<br />
        <b>Type</b> :<br />
        <b> Named Function :</b><br />
        Simple Function is are named function <br />
        <b>Anonymous Function : </b><br />
        In JavaScript, an anonymous function is that type of function that has
        no name or we can say which is without any name. When we create an
        anonymous function, it is declared without any identifier<br />
        <b> Function Expression :</b> <br />A function Expression is way to
        assign a function to a variable. we can assign an anonymous function to
        an variable also named function to variable but mostly used anonymous
        function to variable <br /><b> Arrow Function :</b> <br />
        Arrow functions allows a short syntax for writing function expressions.
        You don't need the function keyword, the return keyword, and the curly
        brackets.<br /><b> IIFE</b> :
        <br />----------------------------------------------<br /><b
          >Callback Function :</b
        >
        <br />A callback function is a function which pass to function as
        argument to another function.<br />
        <b>Higher-Order Function :</b><br />
        Take one or more function as argument or Return a function. <br />
      </p>

      <h1>Q : What is Event Loop ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: Event loop ek core concept hai in JavaScript aur web browsers mein,
        jo asynchronous tasks ko handle karne ke liye use hota hai. JavaScript
        single-threaded hai, iska matlab hai ki ek waqt mein ek hi kaam kar
        sakta hai. Lekin jab asynchronous tasks aate hain, jaise ke I/O
        operations (file read/write), network requests, ya timers (setTimeout),
        to event loop ensure karta hai ke JavaScript apna main kaam khatam karne
        ke baad asynchronous tasks ko handle kare.
        <br />
        <b>Call Stack :</b> Yeh wo jagah hai jahan JavaScript ke synchronous
        functions ko ek ke baad ek execute kiya jata hai<br />
        <b>Task Quee:</b> Jab asynchronous operations complete hote hain, unke
        callbacks ko task queue mein daal diya jata hai. Lekin yeh tab tak
        execute nahi hote jab tak call stack empty na ho.<br />
        <b>Event Loop :</b> Event loop continuously check karta hai agar call
        stack empty hai ya nahi. Jab call stack empty ho jata hai, event loop
        task queue se pehle callback ko utha ke call stack mein daal deta hai
        taake wo execute ho sake.<br />
        <b>Conclusion:</b><br />
        Event loop asynchronous tasks ko efficiently handle karta hai bina
        JavaScript ka synchronous execution block kiye.
      </p>
      <h1>Q : What is hoisting ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: Hoisting is a mechanism in JavaScript that moves variable
        declarations to the top of their scope, whether it's a function or a
        block. but the value will be undefined until the declaration is reached.
        <br />
        let and const: These variables are also hoisted, but they create a
        temporal dead zone (TDZ) until they're declared. Accessing them before
        the declaration results in a ReferenceError.
      </p>
      <h1>Q : What is asynchronous operation ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: asynchronous operation did not block execution code code .
        console.log("First Hello"); setTimeout(() => { console.log("Middle
        Hello"); }, 2000); console.log("Last Hello"); . Asynchronous operations
        wo tasks hote hain jo background mein execute hote hain bina JavaScript
        ke main thread ko block kiye. In operations ka main fayda ye hai ke yeh
        kaam complete hone tak JavaScript ke synchronous code ko rukne nahi
        dete. Jab asynchronous task complete hota hai, tab iska result ya
        callback handle kiya jata hai, jo event loop ke zariye main thread pe
        wapas aata hai.
      </p>
      <h1>Q : when to use callback function?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: callback function are used for Higher Order iterate , Event Handling
        ,asynchronous operation ,  Function and Promises. Callback
        is a function passed to an function as an argument
      </p>
      <h1>Q : What is JavaScript Arrays ?</h1>
      <p>ANS: JavaScript Arrays are used to store the collection values .</p>
      <h1>Q : What is JavaScript Local Scope and Global Scope ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: Local Scope : Variables declared inside the function have local
        scope .which means it can access only inside the functions. Global Scope
        : Variables declared outside any function have Global scope which mean
        they can accessed from anywhere within a program.
      </p>
      <h1>Q : What is difference between var , const and let ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS:In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables,
        but they have different behaviors regarding scope, hoisting, and
        mutability. <br />
        <b> var : </b> <br />
        <b>Scope: </b> Function-scoped or globally-scoped. Variables declared
        with var are accessible throughout the entire function or globally if
        declared outside a function.<br />
        <b> Hoisting:</b> var is hoisted, meaning the declaration is moved to
        the top of its scope, but not the initialization. So, you can reference
        a var variable before its actual line of declaration, though it will be
        undefined until it's initialized. <br /><b>Redeclaration:</b> Variables
        declared with var can be redeclared in the same scope without an
        error.<br />
        <b>Let :<br /></b> <b>Scope: </b> <b>Block-scoped</b> Variables declared
        with let are only accessible within the block (e.g., within {}) they are
        defined. <br />
        <b> Hoisting:</b> let is hoisted but cannot be used before declaration
        (throws a ReferenceError if accessed before initialization due to
        "temporal dead zone"). <br />
        <b> Redeclaration: </b>let cannot be redeclared within the same scope,
        but it can be updated.<br />
        <b>Const :</b><br />
        <b> Scope:</b> Block-scoped like let. The variable is only accessible
        within the block where it is defined.<br />
        <b> Hoisting:</b> const is also hoisted but cannot be accessed before
        declaration due to the "temporal dead zone."<br />
        <b> Mutability: </b>Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned
        after their initial assignment, though if the variable holds an object
        or array, the contents of the object or array can be modified. <br /><b>
          Redeclaration:</b

      </p>

      <h1>Q:What is Promise? why we use it?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: "Producing code" is code that can take some time "Consuming code"
        is code that must wait for the result. A Promise is an Object that links
        Producing code and Consuming code . Promise can be one of three Pending,
        Resolved,or Rejected.
        <br />
        Promise JavaScript mein ek object hota hai jo asynchronous operations ko
        handle karne ke liye use hota hai. Iska purpose future mein resolve hone
        wale values ko manage karna hota hai, chaahe wo successfully resolve ho
        (fulfilled) ya fail ho (rejected). Isme aap future mein kisi event ke
        complete hone par action define kar sakte hain.<br />
        <b>Why</b>
        <br />
        JavaScript asynchronous operations ko handle karne ke liye traditionally
        callbacks ka use karta tha. Lekin callback hell aur complex nested
        callbacks ko avoid karne ke liye Promises ko introduce kiya gaya.
      </p>
      <h1>Q:what is async and await ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: async and await make promises easier to write" async makes a
        function return a Promise await makes a function wait for a Promise The
        await keyword can only be used inside an async function. The await
        keyword makes the function pause the execution and wait for a resolved
        promise before it continues:
      </p>
      <h1>Q:what is Call back hell ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: Callback Hell tab hota hai jab deeply nested callbacks asynchronous
        tasks ko perform karne ke liye use kiye jate hain, jo code ko difficult
        aur unreadable banata hai. Promises aur async/await ka use karke aap
        nested callbacks ko avoid kar sakte hain aur asynchronous code ko more
        readable aur maintainable bana sakte hain.
      </p>

      <h1>Q :What is loop ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: loop is a program way to run a set of code repeatedly until a
        certain condition is met .
      </p>
      <h1>Q:What is javascript loops</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: <b>for</b> : loops through a block of code number of times. For
        loop allows to iterate a block of code a specified number of times<br />
        <b>for/in</b> : loops through the properties of an object.<br />
        <b>for/of</b> : loops through the value of an iterable object.<br />
        <b>while loop</b> : loops through the block of code while specified
        condition. while loop execute a block of code a certain condition is
        true true.<br />
        <b>do/while loop</b> : also loops through the block of code while
        specified condition true. expect that block of code is at least once
        even if condition is false.f<br />
      </p>
      <h1>Q:What is Set Time out and set interval and set time zero ?</h1>
      <p>
        <b>SET TIME OUT :</b> Set time out is used when we want to excaute
        function or something else after some time .<br />
        <b>SET Interval :</b> Set interval is used when we want to excaute some
        javascript repeatedly after the set period of time .<br />
        for (var i = 0; i 3; i++) { setTimeout(function () { console.log(i); },
        3000); }
      </p>
      <h1>Q:What is Closure ?</h1>
      <p>
        A closure is the combination of a function s together (enclosed) with
        references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other
        words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In
        JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at
        function creation time. (Closure ek Function huta hy us along its
        surrounding state ) Example ( function a (){ x= "abdul" function
        displayName(){ console.log(x) } displayName() } a() ) is case may ek
        full function return hogya us ky lexical ky sath
      </p>
      <h1>Difference between FrameWork and library</h1>
      <p>
        <b>FrameWork :</b>The framework controls when to call your code. Less
        flexible. The framework provides a predefined structure and expects your
        code to fit within that structure.A complete solution that includes
        multiple tools to build the entire application.<br />
        <b>library :</b> You call the library when you need it. More flexible.
        You choose the structure of your app and when to use the library.
        Typically focused on one task <br />
      </p>
      <h1>Q: what is For..Each Loop?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS : For..Each Loop is a loop available on an array or object that
        allows you to iterate over each element of the array and perform some
        action on each element.
      </p>
      <h1>Q: what is reduce?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS : reduce() ek powerful function hai jo array ke elements ko process
        karke ek single value return karta hai. Iska use har tarah ke
        aggregation tasks ke liye ho sakta hai, jaise summing, multiplying,
        flattening arrays, counting occurrences, finding maximum/minimum, and
        many more.
      </p>
      <h1>Q: what is map(),filter() and Find()</h1>
      <p>
        ANS : <b>map()</b> ek powerful function hai jo har element ko process
        karke ek naya transformed array banata hai. Yeh array ke elements par
        koi bhi computation ya transformation apply karne ke liye use hota hai,
        aur naya array bina original array ko modify kiye return karta hai.<br />
        <b>filter:</b> ek array method hai jo array ke elements ko filter karta
        hai based on a given condition and returns a new array of all elements
        that satisfy the condition. Agar koi bhi element condition meet nahi
        karta, toh empty array return karta hai.<br />
        <b>find():</b>
        find() ek array method hai jo array ke elements mein se pehla element
        return karta hai jo condition meet karta hai. Agar koi bhi element
        condition match nahi karta, toh undefined return karta hai
      </p>
      <h1>Q: what is Shallow Copy and Deep Copy?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: <b>Shallow Copy:</b> Shallow copy ka matlab hai ke object ya array
        ki top-level properties ko copy kiya jata hai. Agar object ya array ke
        andar nested objects ya arrays hon, toh shallow copy unki references ko
        copy karti hai, na ke unka actual data. Iska matlab agar aap shallow
        copy ka use karke ek nested object ko modify karte hain, toh original
        object ka nested data bhi change ho jata hai kyunki dono same reference
        share karte hain.<br />
        <b>Shallow Copy Methods:</b> <br />Object.assign(): Yeh shallow copy
        banata hai.<br />
        Spread operator (...): Yeh bhi shallow copy banata hai.
        <br />
        ANS: <b>Deep Copy:</b> Deep copy ka matlab hai ke object ya array ki har
        level ka data copy kiya jata hai, including nested objects and arrays.
        Deep copy mein ek completely independent copy banti hai, jisme koi bhi
        reference share nahi hota. Agar deep copy ko modify karte hain, toh
        original object/array bilkul unaffected rehta hai.
        <br />
        <b>Deep Copy Methods:</b> JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()): Yeh ek common
        method hai deep copy banane ka. Lekin yeh method functions ya undefined
        values ko handle nahi karta.
      </p>

      <h1 id="mainHeading">React</h1>
      <h1>Q : what is React ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: React is a JavaScript library for building User interfaces . React
        is use to build single page application . it allows us create reusable
        components . it is created by Facebook
      </p>
      <h1>Q : How does it work (React)?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS:React Create a Virtual DOM in memory. Instead of make change in
        browser DOM Directly it create virtual DOM in memory it does all
        necessary changes in it before make changes in browser DOM. React only
        Change what is Need to Change.

      <h1>Q : What is Es6</h1>
      <p>
        ANS:Es6 is ECMAScript 6. ECMAScript 6 is use to standardize the
        JavaScript . Es6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript

      <h1>
        Q : difference Between state and Props in React ? and it context how to
        give pops t other components
      </h1>
      <p>
        ANS:State: Managed internally by a component, used to store and update
        data within the component itself. Props: Passed down from parent
        components to child components, used to provide data to child
        components.
      </p>

        ANS: when run command npx create-react-app it create a react project in
        directory in this project react give us and folder basic structure ,
        file and dependencies
      </p>
      <h1>Q :What is functional components and class base components?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: Components are Like Function that return Html Elements. Class base
        Components Class components in React are reusable JavaScript classes
        that define UI elements. They use state and lifecycle methods to manage
        component data and behavior, offering more control over complex
        applications compared to functional components. Function Component
        Function components are JavaScript Functions that return JSX. It is
        easier to use and recommended way to make functional components
        ------------- Difference ----------- Functional components are defined
        as JavaScript functions and return JSX. They use hooks for state
        management and side effects. Class components are defined using ES6
        classes and have a this context. They use lifecycle methods for state
        management and side effects.
      </p>
      <h1>Q : What is JSX</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: JSX is JavaScript XML . It allows us to right HTML in React . it
        make easier to write and add html in react.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Q : what are hook? detail Use State Use Effect Use Context Use Reducer
        Use Memo Use Call Back Use Ref
      </h1>
      <p>
        ANS: Hooks are allow function Components to have access on state and
        other features. Use State Use state hook is allow us to mange state in
        components. Use Effect useEffect Hook in React is used to perform side
        effects in functional components. It allows you to do things that don't
        belong in the rendering phase, like fetching data, setting up
        subscriptions, or manipulating the DOM directly.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Q : what did do Use Effect dependencies array do if it have value or not
        ?
      </h1>
      <p>
        ANS:The useEffect hook in React runs side effects in function
        components.<br />
        <b>No Dependencies Array:</b> If you don't pass a second argument (i.e.,
        no dependencies array), the effect will run after every render (on both
        mount and update).
        <br />
        <b>Empty Dependencies Array []: </b>If you pass an empty array, the
        effect will run only once, after the initial render (i.e., when the
        component mounts). It won't run again unless the component unmounts (in
        which case the cleanup function will run, if provided).<br />
        <b> Dependencies Array with Values [dep1, dep2, ...]:</b> When you pass
        an array of dependencies, the effect will run only when any of the
        dependencies change. React compares the current values of the
        dependencies with their previous values. If any value has changed, the
        effect will re-run.<br />
        Summary of Execution: No array: runs on every render. Empty array: runs
        once on mount. Array with values: runs when a dependency value changes.

      <h1>
        Q : Life Cycle Method of components ? Mounting ,Updating Unmounting
      </h1>
      <p>
        ANS: The Life Cycle Method of components in React refers to the sequence
        of stages or phases that a React component goes through from its
        creation to its eventual removal or replacement. Mounting Phase
        (Component Creation): This phase occurs when a component is created and
        inserted into the DOM for the first time. Updating Phase (Component
        Re-rendering): This phase occurs when a components props or state
        change. Unmounting Phase (Component Removal): This phase occurs when a
        component is removed from the DOM.
      </p>
      <h1>Q: what is Higher order Component?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: HOC ek aisa function hota hai jo ek component ko input leta hai aur ek naya component return karta hai, jo additional functionality ya behavior add karta haif
      </p>
      <h1>Q: what is Class based Lifecycle methods?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS: In React, class-based lifecycle methods wo special methods hote
        hain jo React components ke lifecycle ke different stages ko handle
        karte hain. A lifecycle ke different phases hote hain: mounting,
        updating, and unmounting, aur lifecycle methods ko use karke aap in
        different stages mein component ke behavior ko customize kar sakte hain.
        React mein, agar aap class components use kar rahe hain, toh lifecycle
        methods ka istemal kar ke component ki initialization, rendering,

      <h1>Q : redux who it work why we need it what it is ?</h1>
      <p>
        ANS:Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications,
        often used with React. It helps manage and centralize the application's
        global state in a predictable way. In a typical React application, state
        is usually managed locally within components. However, as an application
        grows, managing state across multiple components becomes more complex.
        Redux simplifies this by providing a single source of truth for the
        entire application state and a way to manage it predictably.
